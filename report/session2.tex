\section{Control and Observation}
Below you can find the implementation and results of the close-loop state feedback LQR controller.
Additionally, the results and implementation using a state observer are shown.
\subsection{LQR Design and Implementation}
Given the cost matrices and the linear system model, the LQR gain is computed using the MATLAB function \texttt{dlqr} or alternatively using the Ricatti recursive formula.
In order the observe the convergence of the Ricatti iteration, the singular values of the matrix $\bb{S}_n$ are observed.
For $\bb{Q}_1 = \diag (0, 1, 1, 1, 1)$ and $\bb{Q}_2 = \diag (1, 1)$ the convergence shows a profile as in Figure~\ref{fig:ricatti_svds}.
For other settings of the cost matrices the convergence looks slightly different.
Therefore, to have some when margin for guaranteed convergence upon cost function variance, the iteration number is set to $n_{iterations} = 2500$.

\end{figure}

When the LQR is computed the gain matrix is used as state feedback gain in a closed-loop fashion.
Figure~\ref{fig:lqr_closed} shows the implementation in Simulink.

The LQR state feedback is added to the nominal trajectory for the control input and the sum signal is fed to the system model via a saturation and zero-order hold block. Then, the system output is distorted by noise and certain states are neglected. After subtracting the nominal state trajectory, the state signal is fed to the controller.}

\subsection{LQR Assessment with Ideal Information}

The closed-loop system including the controller is simulated using the second reference path and the results are presented in Figure~\ref{fig:lqr_closed_results}.
The simulation is run for different settings of the cost function, while the first weight for the state cost function is always zero.
On the top left (a) the identically weighted cost function is used and in (b) the weights for the angular values is increased by a factor of $10$.
The higher cost for angle errors leads to higher lateral deviations (state $2$) and lower control input for the steering angle at the same time.
In contrast to that, the lateral deviation is nearly ignored in (c) and only the heading error is considered for control.
In order to obtain a good performance the weight for the lateral deviation is increased and the behavior as in (d) is observed. 
At $t \approx 60s$ the vehicle slightly oscillates around the reference trajectory in the sharp curve, which is undesirable.
To get rid of the oscillation, the cost for steering is decreased, which results in an unstable behavior.
In particular, the system starts to oscillate uncontrollably at the critical sharp curve at $t \approx 60s$ (e).
Finally, by decreasing the weight for the lateral deviation again, a nice performance without oscillations for the settings shown in Figure~\ref{fig:lqr_closed_results} (f) is achieved.

\subsection{LQR Assessment with Imperfect Information}
Below, the performance of the closed-loop system with only imperfect information is evaluated.
From now on, the weights for the cost functions are fixed to the good performing values from Figure~\ref{fig:lqr_closed_results} (f). Namely, the weight matrices are set to $\bb{Q}_1=\diag(0, 5, 1, 1, 1)$ and $\bb{Q}_2=\diag(1, 0.5)$.

\paragraph{Adding Noise to the Fully Observable State:} A zero-mean Gaussian noise signal with standard deviations $\left[1, 1, 0.1745, 2, 0\right]$ is added to the state output as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:lqr_closed}. 
The noise level is comparably high, but the vehicle still can follow the path, with some inaccuracies though (a).
As the control signal is a linear mapping of the observed state vector, also the control signal is highly noisy as there is no filtering at all.
The controller is purely proportional in the observed state and has no filtering effects.
Consider, for instance, the reference angle for the steering angle $u_2$ in (b). 
The control input is highly noisy and saturates nearly everywhere.
However, the actuator dynamics (eq.~\ref{eq:ss5}) has low pass behavior and filters out the noise from the control input.
In the diagram showing the evolution of the states (c) it is observable that the actual steering angle shows the filtered version of the control input with nearly no noise (state 5).

As we have zero-mean noise and the actuators have low-pass behavior (eq. \ref{eq:ss4} and \ref{eq:ss5}) the closed-loop system still behaves properly and the accuracy is reasonable even with this comparatively high level of noise.

	\caption{Performance of the LQR state feedback controller, when the state signal is distorted by noise. As the control signal is a linear mapping of the observed state vector without integrators or filters, the control signal is highly noisy as well. However, the system actuators have low-pass behavior and filter out the noise and the system still behaves properly and follow the path with small inaccuracies. Note that zero-mean Gaussian noise is used.}
	\label{fig:noisy_states}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Neglecting a State: } In addition, one of the states is neglected and not fed to the controller.
In particular, we neglect the third state expressing the heading error $\theta_e$, i.e. the controller has no information about the heading error of the vehicle.
Note, that the noise is still activated with the same settings as before.
The resulting system behavior is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:partially_states}.
In this setting, the controller always thinks the heading error is zero and the vehicle does not properly track the path.
After the some time the control input for the reference steering angle is saturated all the time and the vehicle keeps moving an small circles.
Even though there are some small peaks with positive sign, these are filtered out by the low-pass behavior of the steering wheel actuator and the steering wheel stays approximately at $-\frac{\pi}{2}$.
For the selected cost function, the LQR state-feedback gain matrix is
\begin{equation}
	\bb{K}_{D_{LQR}} = \begin{bmatrix}
	0.0000 &  -0.0000  & -0.0000  &  0.4069 &  -0.0000\\
    0.0000  &  3.1360 &  10.5130 &  -0.0000  &  3.3271	
	\end{bmatrix}\, .
\end{equation}
Accordingly, the reference steering angle is affected by the lateral deviation $x_2$, the heading error $x_3$ and the actual steering angle $x_5$. 
As the lateral deviation becomes large and the actual steering angle can not go beyond $-\frac{\pi}{2}$ and $\frac{\pi}{2}$ the feedback value is nearly always positive as the lateral deviation is large.
As the heading is not measured it is not available to compensate the largely positive values introduced by the feedback of the lateral deviation and the vehicle looses control.
